**DETAILS OF PUBLIC ISSUANCE - LIQUIDITY BOOTSTRAPPING POOL**

| Acquisition Price per Token (in USD) | **: Starting at $** 3.00 USD |
| --- | --- |
| Selected Accepted Digital Currency | : **USDC** |
| Actual Tokens Acquired | : **$VSTA**** Tokens** |

The Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool is a mechanism that allows You to acquire Tokens at any price. The mechanics of the pool relies on the concept of &#39;_supply and demand&#39;_. Should there be no acquisitions of the Token over a period of time, the Acquisition Price would gradually decrease and vice versa, where acquisitions of the Token would result in the increment of the Acquisition Price.

There is no Maximum Acquisition Amount Threshold that is actively set by the Token Issuer. You will be able to buy any amount of Tokens You intend to purchase so long as the Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool allows it.

**ANNEX 3**

**RISK FACTORS**

_You should carefully consider and evaluate each of the following risk factors and all other information contained in this Agreement before deciding to participate in the Token Issuance. To the best of the Governance Token Issuer&#39;s knowledge and belief, all risk factors which are material to You in making an informed judgment to participate in the Token Issuance have been set out below. If any of the following considerations, uncertainties or material risks develop into actual events, the business, financial position and/or results of operations of the Governance Token Issuer or the Project Group and the development, maintenance and level of usage of the Vesta Finance Platform could be materially and adversely affected. In such cases, the trading price of Tokens (in the case where they are listed on a cryptocurrency exchange) could decline due to any of these considerations, uncertainties or material risks, and You may lose all or part of your Tokens._

(1) **RISKS RELATING TO PARTICIPATION IN THE TOKEN ISSUANCE**

_**This Agreement may not be transferred without the consent of the Governance Token Issuer**_

This Agreement provides that You may not transfer or assign this Agreement without the consent of the Governance Token Issuer.

_**The tax treatment of this Agreement, the acquisition rights contained herein, and the Token Issuance is uncertain and there may be adverse tax consequences for You upon certain future events.**_

The tax characterization of this Agreement and the Tokens are uncertain, and You must seek your own tax advice in connection with an acquisition of Tokens. An acquisition of Tokens pursuant to this Agreement may result in adverse tax consequences to You, including withholding taxes, income taxes, and tax reporting requirements. You should consult with and must rely upon the advice of your own professional tax advisors with respect to the tax treatment of an acquisition of Tokens pursuant to this Agreement.

_**Token transactions may be irreversible and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions; or malfunctioning of the Token or unintended function may not be recoverable.**_

Transactions in the Tokens may be irreversible and, accordingly, an acquirer of the Tokens may lose all the Tokens in a variety of circumstances, including in connection with fraudulent or accidental transactions, technology failures or cyber-security breaches. If applicable, real-time settlement would further increase the risk that correction of trading errors may be impossible and losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable.

Additionally, the Tokens and any network with which the Tokens are interacting may malfunction or function in an unexpected or unintended manner. This may be caused by a Token itself, such networks or a number of other causes, some of which are foreseeable. Any malfunction or unintended function could also result in the complete loss of the Tokens.

Because there is a lack of a central regulatory authority and structure and due to the global nature of digital assets and blockchain technologies. You may have limited or no legal remedies or recourse against the Project Group, the Governance Token Issuer, other users, holders, acquirers or sellers of the Tokens, and any other person or entity that may interfere with the Tokens or your digital wallet.

_**There is no assurance of any success of the Project and the**_ **Vesta Finance** _**Platform.**_

The Project and Vesta Finance Platform has not been fully developed, finalized, and integrated and is subject to further changes, updates, and adjustments prior to its launch. Such changes may result in unexpected and unforeseen effects on its projected appeal to users, and hence impact its success.

_**Alternative interoperable solutions may be established that compete with or are more widely used than the**_ **Vesta Finance** _**Platform.**_

It is possible that alternative technology solutions could be established that attempt to facilitate services that are materially similar to the services offered on the Vesta Finance Platform, and the Project may compete with these alternative platforms.

_**The cryptocurrencies raised in the Token Issuance are exposed to risks of theft.**_

The Governance Token Issuer will make every effort to ensure that the cryptocurrencies received from the Token Issuance will be securely held at such Receiving Address(es). Further, upon receipt of the cryptocurrencies, the Governance Token Issuer will make every effort to ensure that the cryptocurrencies received will be securely held through the implementation of security measures. Notwithstanding such security measures, there is no assurance that there will be no theft of the cryptocurrencies as a result of hacks, mining attacks (including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, &quot;selfish-mining&quot; attacks and race condition attacks), sophisticated cyber-attacks, as well as other new forms of attack that may be created, distributed denials of service or errors, vulnerabilities or defects on the Receiving Addresses, the Bitcoin blockchain, Ethereum blockchain, or any other blockchain or otherwise. Such events may include, for example, flaws in programming or source code leading to exploitation or abuse thereof. Mining attacks may also target other blockchain networks with which the Tokens interact, which may consequently significantly impact the Tokens.

In such event, even if the Token Issuance is completed, the Governance Token Issuer may not be able to receive the cryptocurrencies raised and the Governance Token Issuer may not be able to utilize such funds for the development of the Vesta Finance Platform, and the launch of the Vesta Finance Platform might be temporarily or permanently curtailed. As such, the issued Tokens may hold little worth or value, and this would impact their trading price.

The Tokens, as a store of value, are not like bank accounts or other similar accounts and are entirely uninsured, unless You specifically obtain private insurance to insure them. Any value they may hold at any time may decrease or be limited in the future. In the event of any loss or loss of value of the Tokens, You may have no recourse.

_**If**_ **Vesta Finance** _**Platform&#39;s security is compromised or if they are subjected to attacks that frustrate or thwart users&#39; ability to access**_ **Vesta Finance** _**Platform and its products and services, users may cut back on or stop using**_ **Vesta Finance** _**Platform altogether, which could seriously curtail the utility of the Governance Tokens**_

The Project and Vesta Finance Platform is still in an early development stage and are unproven, and there can be no assurances that Vesta Finance Platform and the creating, transfer or storage of the Tokens will be uninterrupted or fully secure which may result in a complete loss to users&#39; Tokens or an unwillingness of users to access, adopt and utilize Vesta Finance Platform. Further, the Project&#39;s reserve system may also be the target of malicious attacks seeking to identify and exploit weaknesses in the software or Vesta Finance Platform which may result in the loss or theft of Tokens. For example, if the Tokens and the respective underlying protocols and Vesta Finance Platform are subject to unknown and known security attacks (such as malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing, spoofing, social engineering, phishing emails, man-in-the-middle, phone hijacking, double-spend attacks, 51% attacks, ransomware, consensus-based or other malicious attacks), this may materially and adversely affect the Project and the Vesta Finance Platform.

_**The further development and acceptance of blockchain networks and blockchain-based tokens, including**_ **Vesta Finance** _**Platform and the Tokens, which are part of a new and rapidly changing industry, are subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate. The slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of blockchain networks and blockchain assets would have a material adverse effect on the successful development and adoption of**_ **Vesta Finance** _**Platform.**_

The growth of the blockchain industry in general, as well as the blockchain networks with which Vesta Finance Platform will rely and interact, is subject to a high degree of uncertainty. The factors affecting the further development of the cryptocurrency industry, as well as blockchain networks, include, without limitation:

· worldwide growth in the adoption and use of Bitcoin and other blockchain technologies;

· government and quasi-government regulation of Bitcoin and other blockchain assets and their use, or restrictions on or regulation of access to and operation of blockchain networks or similar systems;

· the maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol of blockchain networks;

· changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences;

· general economic conditions and the regulatory environment relating to cryptocurrencies; or

· a decline in the popularity or acceptance of Bitcoin or other blockchain-based tokens.

_**There may be weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs in the protocols, systems, and smart contracts in connection with the Token Issuance and / or**_ **Vesta Finance** _**Platform.**_

The Project Group will make reasonable efforts to ensure that the protocols, systems, and smart contracts in connection with the Token Issuance and / or the Project are audited, tested, and approved by technical experts.

However, we may rely on technology, including smart contracts, to implement certain restrictions on transferability in accordance with the federal securities law of the United States of America. Smart contract technology is still in its early stage of development and there can be no assurance that such technology will function properly. Its application of experimental nature carries significant operation, technological, financial, regulatory, financial and reputational risks, there are inherent risks that such protocols, systems, and / or smart contracts could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities, or bugs which could result in technological limitations or transferability and expose the Project Group to legal and regulatory issues. Smart contracts may not be fit for the purpose intended by the Project Group and may contain flaws, vulnerabilities or other issues, which may cause technical problems or the complete loss of Tokens.

Acquirers of Tokens should understand and accept that there are no warranties that Tokens are fit for a particular purpose or do not contain any weaknesses, vulnerabilities, or bugs which would cause loss in their worth or value. In the event that any of the aforementioned risks materializes, the business strategies, results of operations and outlook of the Project Group may also be adversely affected.

_**There may be risks relating to acts of God, natural disasters, wars, terrorist attacks, riots, civil commotions widespread communicable diseases and other force majeure events beyond the control of the Project Group.**_

The Token Issuance and the performance of the activities of the Project Group and / or Vesta Finance Platform may be interrupted, suspended or delayed due to acts of God, natural disasters, wars, terrorist attacks, riots, civil commotions widespread communicable diseases and other force majeure events beyond the control of the Project Group. Such events could also lead to uncertainty in the economic outlook of global markets and there is no assurance that such markets will not be affected, or that recovery from the global financial crisis would continue. In such events, the business strategies, results of operations and outlook of the Project Group may be materially and adversely affected. Further, if an outbreak of such infectious or communicable diseases occurs in any of the countries in which the Project Group, the developers, data providers and / or data consumers have operations in the future, market sentiment could be adversely affected and this may have a negative impact on Vesta Finance Platform and the community.

_**There may be unanticipated risks arising from the Tokens.**_

Cryptographic tokens such as the Tokens are a relatively new and dynamic technology. In addition to the risks included herein, there are other risks associated with your acquisition, holding and use of the Tokens, including those that the Project Group cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed herein.

**(2) RISKS RELATING TO THE RECEIVING ADDRESSES AND WALLETS**

_**The Receiving Addresses may be compromised and the cryptocurrencies may not be able to be disbursed.**_

The Receiving Addresses are designed to be secure. However, in the event that the Receiving Addresses are, for any reason compromised (including but not limited to scenarios where the private key to such Receiving Addresses is lost, destroyed or otherwise compromised), the funds held by the Receiving Addresses may not be able to be retrieved and disbursed, and may be permanently unrecoverable. In such an event, even if the Token Issuance is successful, the Project Group will not be able to receive funds raised and the Project Group will not be able to utilize such funds for the development of Vesta Finance Platform, and the implementation of Vesta Finance Platform may be temporarily or permanently curtailed. As such, distributed Tokens may hold little worth or value or may be rendered worthless, and this would impact their trading price.

_**The loss or compromise of information relating to your acquirer Digital Wallet may affect your access and possession of the Tokens.**_

Your access to the Tokens (if any) in your Acquirer Digital Wallet depends on among other things, the safeguards to the information to such Acquirer Digital Wallet, including but not limited to the user account information, address, private key, and password. In the event that any of the foregoing is lost or compromised, your access to the Acquirer Digital Wallet may be curtailed and thereby adversely affecting your access and possession to the Tokens, including such Tokens being unrecoverable and permanently lost.

_**Your elected Digital Wallet to receive Governance Tokens or your elected Digital Wallet service provider may not be technically compatible with the Tokens.**_

Your elected Digital Wallet to receive Governance Tokens or your Digital Wallet service provider may not be technically compatible with the Tokens which may result in the delivery of Tokens being unsuccessful or affect your access to such Tokens.
